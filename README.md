# Hash Table Implementation with Linear Probing and Double Hashing
This Java program implements a hash table with open addressing using linear probing and double hashing. The program consists of a class called 'HW4_rci11' that encapsulates the hash table functionality. The main method in the class demonstrates the usage of both linear probing and double hashing, inserting keys into the hash table and printing the results.
## Usage
### Compilation
Compile the program using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

/njavac HW4_rci11

### Execution
Run the compiled program using the following command:

/njava HW4_rci11

This will execute the main method in the 'HW4_rci11' class, showcasing the steps of linear probing and double hashing, as well as printing the final hash tables.
## Important Notes
* Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
* The program is designed to be run in a terminal or command prompt.
